# Getting Started
This project uses IBM Skills Network Labs (SN Labs), which is a virtual lab environment. Additional setup might be required to run this locally.
My files are included here. You can watch a short video of the build here: [Lingo Link](https://youtu.be/BZ3pPQsSNFc)

# About this project
An AI-powered voice translation assistant using Watsonx and IBM Watson Speech Libraries for seamless multilingual voice interaction.

This project involved creating a voice translation assistant using Watsonx and IBM Watson Speech Libraries. The assistant takes voice input, converts it to text, sends the text to Watsonx's flan-ul2 model for translation, and converts the translated text back to speech. The front-end is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the back-end uses Flask.

The assistant provides real-time translations in multiple languages, demonstrating practical AI applications in communication. The project combines natural language processing, speech recognition, and web development to create a comprehensive AI-driven solution.
